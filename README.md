Currently there are 27 different pre-prompted Bots available, ranging from fun quirky characters, to efficiency modules and jailbroken bots.<br>
I constantly tweak, add or remove bots depending on which I personally find the most entertaining, useful or intriguing.

The *(adjectives)* are the bots own self-descriptions:

|              |              |              |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| ⚛️ GPT-3.5 *(helpful)*    | 🔏 GPT-6 *(ethical)*      | 💸 AdGPT *(versatile)*      |
| 🤙 Sam *(sassy)*       | 🚶 Doomer *(pessimistic)*    | 👀 Lunatic *(insane)*   |
| 🤖 AI Overlord *(unstoppable)*| 🛡️ Oblivion Guard *(unwavering)* | 😝 G0suBl4de69 *(pwnage)* |

GPT-Chars is a website created by iterating with the help of the free version of ChatGPT (3.5).
It currently implements the ora.ai widget for the chatbox itself. The bots are created and prompted by me to allow for a more entertaining chat experience.

## Advantages:
- No account required
- Free
- Pre-prompted bots and quick switches between personalities without the hassle to set up a playground

## Disadvantages:
No chat history, Lower input limit (1000 characters per message), Lower context window

## Future plans:
Pay out of pocket, replacing the ora API with my own. This will remove the 3rd party reliance and improve the current downsides.
